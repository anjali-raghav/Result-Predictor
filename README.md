# Result-Predictor

This program uses machine learning algorithm to predict the result of final year engineering students of Computer Science graduates of Guru Gobind Singh Indraprashta University. The intution to build this project was , during novel corona virus pandemic, it was difficult to conduct examination of students. 

The dataset was build by making aggeregate marks of each semester of each student. Further support vector machine, decision tree, random forest regressors were used to predict the output.A comparitive analysis was performed.
